# A Good Start of the Week

It's Monday and I had to go to school. I did not have much time but I completed the tasks I set yesterday anyways. 
The original planning of unsoldering the unused lights from the light modules was pretty much not going well. With the help from one of my friends Terrance, we decided to twist the lights out using force. It was quite fierce but effective overall. And Nathan will take over the design of the case for me.
Besides, I made what I think is a better budget spreadsheet for the F1 in Schools Competition. I adapted the approach of researching on the internet and also the advice from AI to see how a standard budget spreadsheet is made. I integrated the format into the original spreadsheet, and hopefully, Ailsa, the design engineering, would not blame me again.
I did not have the time to start revising for my seen dictation on Wednesday, so I will leave the revision for tomorrow.
