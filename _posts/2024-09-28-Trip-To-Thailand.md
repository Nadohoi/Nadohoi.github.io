# Trip To Thailand
I haven't written dairies for days, as I have been busying preparing for the competition in Thailand. 
It is my third day in Thailand and I am glad that my stomach is still fine. 

The reaction time game runs well, despite some power supply issues. The power banks would stop supplying power every minute, but the problem was solved by connecting the micrbit to the power strip. 
The machine definitely has to be improved before going to the Hong Kong Regional Competition. I plan to use other microcontrollers with the function that can delay a code piece while running the false start detection simulatenously. 
I believe that we could grab more people's attentions by enlarging the size of the game, and beautify it by applying a 3D-printed case.

In addition, the budget and expense spreadsheets can be enhanced by applying the design elements. I will probably look into methods that we can summarise the small expense items into more general items.

That's probably all for today.
