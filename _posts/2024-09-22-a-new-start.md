## A New Start

Hello, this is Rei. After listening from one of my best friends, Mr Nathan, I decided to start writing my blogs so track my daily life. I hope this will bring me some benefits like a better time management, and I really look forward to completing tasks more efficiently. I don't like my personal life exposed to the internet though, but I will try writing blogs probably daily from now on. Thank you and stay tuned!
