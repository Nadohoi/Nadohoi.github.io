Hello, this is Rei. This is going to be my first diary record, there might be some gramatical issues but please bear with me. I was struggling to complete the physics homework, which I shouldn't but wasted much time in the morning. It was quite frastrating. Anyways, I started dealing with the bugs of the reaction time game for the pit display of F1 In Schools, which I encountered last week. It seemed like some of the pins wouldn't work, so I spent quite some time to connect the lights to the Microbit with those functioning pins. Besides, I was able to complete my homework, and also the chemistry revision paper before 12am, which I think is quite cheering. I need to unsolder the unused lights, design a case for the system, revise for chemistry test and hopefully my seen dictation which is on Wednesday.
